# qurated 

Qurated is a collection of packages curated by a community of folk (initially, internally at Quansight) that,
when put together, allows people to have and deploy Jupyter notebooks easily.

This here serves as the mono-repo for the application, and `qurated-theme` will house the themeing components.
